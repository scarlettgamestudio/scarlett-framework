# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Project setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. `$ yarn` to install dependencies
3. `$ yarn run validate` to validate you've got it working
4. Create a branch for your PR

## Committing and Pushing changes

This project uses [`semantic-release`][semantic-release] to do automatic releases and generate a changelog based on the
commit history. So we follow [a convention][convention] for commit messages. Please follow this convention for your
commit messages.

You can use `commitizen` to help you to follow [the convention][convention]

Once you are ready to commit the changes, please use the below commands

1. `$ git add <files to be committed>`
2. `$ yarn run commit`

... and follow the instruction of the interactive prompt.

### opt into git hooks

There are git hooks set up with this project that are automatically installed when you install dependencies. They're
really handy, but are turned off by default (so as to not hinder new contributors). You can opt into these by creating
a file called `.opt-in` at the root of the project and putting this inside:

```
commit-msg
pre-commit
```

Also, please watch the repo and respond to questions/bug reports/feature requests! Thanks!
